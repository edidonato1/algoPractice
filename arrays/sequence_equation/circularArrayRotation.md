Given a sequence of n integers,p(1), p(2), ..., p(n)  where each element is distinct and satisfies 1<= p(x) <= n. For each x where 1 <= x <= n, find any integer y such that p(p(y)) === x and print the value of y on a new line.


Complete the permutationEquation function in the editor below. It should return an array of integers that represent the values of y.

permutationEquation has the following parameter(s):

p: an array of integers
